The random sentence generator is a fascinating tool that generates a wide array of sentences on various topics. It's a creative resource for writers, helping them find inspiration and develop their writing skills by exploring different sentence structures and themes. Whether you need a writing prompt or simply enjoy the randomness of language, this tool offers endless possibilities for linguistic exploration.

## How it works?

The **Generator** is based on the following **model**:

* [Sentence] = **Who** + **Action** + **Details**
  
  * Who = **Name** | **Name** from **Place**

    * Names = {"Emily", "Daniel", "Olivia"...}
    * Places = {"Sofia", "Paris", "London"...}
      
  * Action = **Verb** + **Noun** | **Adverb** + **Verb** + **Noun**

    * Adverbs = {"quickly", "quietly", "loudly"...} 
    * Verbs = {"runs", "jumps",  "sings"...}
    * Nouns = {"cat", "bicycle", "ocean"...}

  * Details = {"near the riverbank", "at the top of a mountain", "inside a cozy cafe"...}
